Non-sucky Rubygem management.


# Usage

To install a gem, use the `gem` type.  It handles a bunch of things that the
standard `package` type doesn't, like alternate Ruby environments,
non-standard sources, and **being able to request having the same gem
installed multiple times without causing Puppet to shit its britches** (I
know, I know, we're living in the future, huh?)

Rather than give extensive usage examples here, just read the docs for the
type itself.  It tells you all about it.
